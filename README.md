Test project - Expense Tracker web application

The requirements for the test project are:
Could you write me a Expense Tracker web application where:
- User must be able to create an account and log in
- When logged in, user can see and edit expenses he entered
- When entered, each expense has Date, Time, Description, Amount, Comment
- User can filter expenses
- User can print expenses per week with total amount, and average day spending
- Minimal UI/UX design is needed.
- I need every client operation done using JavaScript, reloading the page is
not an option.
- REST API â€“ for all entities
- You need to be able to pass credentials to both the webpage and the API.
- As complementary to the last item, one should be able to create users in the system via an interface, probably a signup/register screen.

NOTE: Keep in mind that this is the project that will be used to evaluate your skills.
So we do expect you to make sure that the app is fully functional and doesn't have any obvious missing pieces.
